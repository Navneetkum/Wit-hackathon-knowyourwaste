#### This Repository consists of 3 branches 

1.flask-py-app is for CNN based algorithm which is used for classifying our data.
2.Backend folder makes a connection between mysql db and our code .
3.src code represnts our main react UI .



## 1. What is the definition that you are working on 

We are aiming to educate people ans spread awarness about importance of proper waste segregation.
Improper Waste disposal not only contribute to creation of greenhouse gases  but also cause significant harm to marine and wildlife .
Even if you are 100 kms away from costline ,you can be equally responsible for choping the marine life.
    
#### 2. How are we trying to solve the problem ?

Here, we are making Deep Learning Model of Waste segregation which will identify the type of waste i.e., Biodegradable, Non-Biodegradable (Sub class: Recyclable, Resuable).
This model then can be used by people to segregate the waste and then give it to garbage collector who will give them points which can  be redeemed by them .
Here we are using mysql db for storing the user points  and node js for connecting our react app to database .

#### 3. The Tech stack we used
Mysql, Node js ,Tensorflow, Flask, React.js, Heroku, IBM cloud .

#### 4. Working of our project

1. We have developed machine learning model on heroku app which will be used for classification of waste.(https://glacial-wave-95212.herokuapp.com/).
2. This can be used by registered residents of any society for seggregating the waste.
3. The application will be used by garbage collector and they'll be registered on different page.
4. Grabage collector will give points to society residents on the basis of how well they have seggregated the waste.
5. Points will be used by residents for shopping or other benefits.
6. This will increase the awarness about wastes and points will motivate them to do so.
